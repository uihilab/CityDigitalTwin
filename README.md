## Introduction
Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding due to climate change and rapid urbanization. Traditional mapping and decision-support tools lack the capability to integrate real-time data or analyze cascading disruptions across interconnected urban systems. Digital twins offer a promising solution by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of urban environments.

This project presents a comprehensive, city-scale digital twin framework that integrates flood forecasting, transportation networks, and critical infrastructure systems into a unified, real-time cyberinfrastructure. By leveraging data from sensors, hydrological models, and geographic information systems (GIS), the framework provides a dynamic and interactive platform for city planners and emergency managers to visualize, analyze, and proactively manage urban flood events and their cascading impacts.
